Implementation of ML and DL algorithms from scratch using vanilla Python and Numpy library.

The list of algorithms implemented are :

## K-Means
K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. It allows us to cluster the data into different groups and a convenient way to discover the categories of groups in the unlabeled dataset on its own without the need for any training.
